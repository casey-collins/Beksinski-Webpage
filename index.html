                    <p>Zdzislaw Beksinski is a Polish based artist who studied architecture in Krakow in the early 1950’s. While he is best known as a painter, he is skilled in many artistic mediums such as photography, sculpture, and digital media. Unsatisfied
                        with how limiting photographic editing can be at the time, he turned to painting.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>His work is in the style of Dystopian Surrealism, with each piece depicting nightmarish landscapes and figures. Beksinski put a strong emphasis on realism in his works; he wishes to paint his dreams as if he were taking photos of them.
                        While his pieces are described as dark, depressing, and downright graphic, one can gather a sense of beauty that conflicts with their bleak tones. His paintings have no specific meaning or hidden-message behind them, and prefers
                        to let the viewers interpret the works in their own way; which is why most of his pieces are untitled.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>His primary source of inspiration comes from his dreams and music. He often listens to classical music while working in his studio, and uses his photographs to carefully plan every aspect of his pieces.
